# Research

\toc

I work on questions of economic subjectivity, gender, development, identity, and postcoloniality/globalization.
I was Editor of *Rethinking Marxism* from August 2009 - July 2013 and served as an active member of its editorial board for over a decade (June 1997 to June 2000, July 2007 to July 2016).
I completed two terms as an elected member of the Governing Board of the Cultural Studies Association (US) in May 2015.
I twice served as an elected board member for the International Association for Feminist Economics, and acted as the convener/co-convener for the Feminist Pre-conference at the South Asian conference (Madison, WI) from 2005-2009.
