# Teaching & Classes

My teaching aims to make the classroom a space for critical thinking and creative experimentation.
I organize this in terms of three broad categories: skill development, active learning, and integration of interdisciplinary approaches and materials.
I want my students to be critical thinkers, but beyond that, I want them to gain a sense of themselves as capable producers of knowledge, to inspire them with a passion for learning and knowledge creation in whatever forms work for them.
My role is to help them make that journey.
