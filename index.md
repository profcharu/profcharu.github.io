## Meet Professor Charu!
I am an economist who works in the areas of gender, globalization, development, and postcoloniality.
Over the years, I have become increasingly convinced that as a field, we can meet our intellectual mandate to provide knowledge that is useful to address issues we face, by taking an interdisciplinary approach.

I am currently a Professor in the \style{text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;}{School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences at the University of Washington, Bothell}.
Before that I have held tenured/tenure track positions in Women and Gender Studies at UNLV and at the University of Hawai\`i at Manoa, and in Economics at Franklin & Marshall College.
I got my doctorate in Economics at UMASS Amherst (a special shout-out to the amazing folks there), and was particularly lucky to work with Social Thought and Political Economy at UMass (woohoo STPEC!).
I also got to do some short lecturer/teaching/tutoring stints for CCBEMS at UMass, and for students at Smith and Mt. Holyoke - these experiences early in my career shaped me, and Smith and Mt. Holyoke really gave me a feel for my own undergraduate experience at Miranda House College at DU - MH faculty gave me the courage and boost I needed very early on to buck the trend and focus on my own vision for what I thought an economist can do and be (this was the 1980s, and to NOT to IIM, MBA, Management, free markets, neoliberalism, was viewed as professional death back then - thanks MH!).

About the name S. Charusheela: you can learn more about it [here]().

The rest of this site gives you a sense of my projects, teaching, etc.  

Final note - while my name is up there at top of this site, this is not just my own work - very many people have made the videos, pages, etc. over here. Kenneth, Melissa, Sofi, and especially Thenmozhi - dhanyavaad, shukriya, mahalo nui loa! 

PS. If you find the site useful, use what works for you, but do respect copyleft/creative commons.  Link yes; copy, edit and fail to give credit, NO.  This site really would not happen without the amazing work of a large number of people - when you steal such work, you don't really steal just from me, you really do serious hurt for folks who are usually not seen except in credits, but without whom none of this would happen.
